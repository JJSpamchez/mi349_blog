  <br>
  <p>To put it simply, Into The Woods is perfect. It easily has one of the most understandable through-lines of a plot. The characters are intentionally very recognizable archetypes of fairytale characters, and as a result, don’t ask a lot of the audience as far as “figuring them out.” Little Red’s grandma is dead, the Witch is evil, and the Princes are jerks. </p>
    <br>
  <p> On top of the characters being easy to get an initial read on, almost every character and theme are accompanied by a musical motif. Every time the Witch enters the scene, you hear a more gentle reimagining of the song she sang when she was first on stage. Every single character has this feature, it’s nearly impossible to get lost.</p>
    <br>
  <p>The repetition of the music and simplicity of the characters gives way to some interesting twists and turns in the story. Since the audience is already locked into what’s happening, Into The Woods can do new things with its characters. The comedy of the show really gets to shine when out of nowhere, Little Red Riding Hood is killing people with knives, and the Rapunzel is all but a completely detached and deranged psychopathic mess. Couldn’t recommend it enough. </p>
