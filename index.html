  <p>To put it simply, Into The Woods is perfect. It easily has one of the most understandable through-lines of a plot. The characters are intentionally very recognizable archetypes of fairytale characters, and as a result, don’t ask a lot of the audience as far as “figuring them out.” Little Red’s grandma is dead, the Witch is evil, and the Princes are jerks. </p>

  <p> On top of the characters being easy to get an initial read on, almost every character and theme are accompanied by a musical motif. Every time the Witch enters the scene, you hear a more gentle reimagining of the song she sang when she was first on stage. Every single character has this feature, it’s nearly impossible to get lost.</p>

  <p>The repetition of the music and simplicity of the characters gives way to some interesting twists and turns in the story. Since the audience is already locked into what’s happening, Into The Woods can do new things with its characters. The comedy of the show really gets to shine when out of nowhere, Little Red Riding Hood is killing people with knives, and the Rapunzel is all but a completely detached and deranged psychopathic mess. Couldn’t recommend it enough. </p>

  <h3>Blog 2: How Raising Cane's is an Overrated Masterpiece</h3>

  <p>Raising Cane’s is one of Michigan State's most popular places to eat. Without outing my endeavors too much, I frequently find myself there past midnight. We all know what it’s doing there, we all know why it’s open so late, and none of us are surprised by its success. But why, then, would I dare to say such terribly controversial and sacrilegious things?</p>

   <p>As someone who has plenty of experience, I can safely say that my opinion on this topic is not an opinion, but abject fact. Jokes aside, Cane’s suffers from its success in a very obvious way. There are simply too many people trying to get Cane’s at once, and as a result, not every meal can have hours upon hours of thought and care put into them.</p>

   <p>The chicken, fries, and God forbid the toast are often soggy inside the container they’re delivered in. I can’t recall a time when at least one nugget or section of fries wasn’t noticeably damp. This being said, this same amount of care doesn’t need to be applied to the signature Cane’s sauce, which is fantastic. Since the Cane’s sauce is undoubtedly just shipped to the restaurant in containers, as long as it’s properly refrigerated and not horribly expired or tainted, you are guaranteed one excellent part of every meal at Raising Cane’s, their heavenly Cane’s sauce.</p>

    <h4>Below is a table that shows how one can achieve spiritual enlightenment through Cane's Sauce indulgement.</h4>
