<p>Joel Sanchez is a student in MI 349 who finally caved and is doing all of his coding in GitHub. Joel thanks Professor Siarto for telling him to make this change.</p>

  <p>In his free time, Joel:</p>
   
  <ul>
  <li>Makes a list (as seen here),</li>
  <li>Adds things to the list he's made,</li>
  <li>Tells everybody he knows to watch Arcane because it's his favorite show,</li>
  <li>Finishes lists by typing this exact line of text.</li>

  <h2> Here are some fun facts/interests! </h2>
<p> Currently, my favorite movie is Wall-E. It’s a movie I watched a lot as a kid, but there’s an undeniable charm and simplicity that it maintains all these years later. A lot of movies have super complex characters and insane, multi-layered writing, but sometimes, I want to watch the movie where two cute robots fall in love by saving the world. Sometimes, that’s enough. Conversely, my current favorite album is Electric Light Orchestra’s “Out of the Blue.” There’s a ton going on and the album tells a complete story through the text of its music. It’s taken me a ton of listens to fully get it, and I’m 100% sure there’s still something I’m missing. My favorite video game is Super Mario Galaxy (a lot of space going on here (maybe I bring that up in therapy(?))). It is one of the best games ever made, in my very biased opinion. The level design is phenomenal, the soundtrack is near perfection, and the controls are buttery smooth.</p>
<p> On the real, this project was pretty stressful for me to complete. I’d love more insight as to how I might maintain a good grade in the course, as difficulties with the first HTML project (hopefully you remember, I saw you before class started and we both couldn’t figure out why my visual studio wasn’t working) caused me to not finish it, resulting in basically a guaranteed zero. Since a lot of stuff is ungraded so far, I’m left pretty stressed about my grade for the course. Any and all feedback would be greatly appreciated, as I very desperately would like to do well in this course.</p>
<p> All that being said, I hope this project was acceptable given the rubric given to us. I adapted to working exclusively with github’s coding system, and it was less than optimal compared to systems I’ve worked with in the past. Hopefully, that didn’t show too much, and I did a passable job. Again, please let me know if this is not the case and how I can improve in the future.</p>
