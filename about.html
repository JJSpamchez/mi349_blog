<h1>Joel Sanchez</h1>
   
<p>Joel Sanchez is a student in MI 349 who finally caved and is doing all of his coding in GitHub. Joel thanks Professor Siarto for telling him to make this change.</p>
 
  <p>In his free time, Joel:</p>
   
  <ul>
  <li>Makes a list (as seen here),</li>
  <li>Adds things to the list he's made,</li>
  <li>Tells everybody he knows to watch Arcane because it's his favorite show,</li>
  <li>Finishes lists by typing this exact line of text.</li>
</ul>
